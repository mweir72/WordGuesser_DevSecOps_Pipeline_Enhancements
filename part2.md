This codebase originated as an assignment for a software engineering course wherein students would incrementally develop a ruby version of Wordguesser (Hangman) using BDD and TDD, then wrap it in a Sinatra web server.

In this DevOps course, we will use the completed solution to this assignment as a starting point in an exercise to containerize the app and add it to a CI/CD pipeline.

# Part 2 — Containerize & Test the Wordguesser App

## Goals
- Build a Docker image for the app  
- Run the app locally via a container  
- Run RSpec and Cucumber **inside** the container  
- Use a simple Docker Compose setup that’s easy to extend later

---

## A. Files You Will Add

### 1) `Dockerfile`

Copy the following contents into a new file named **Dockerfile** at the project root.

````dockerfile
# Use an official Ruby image with build tools so native gems can compile if needed.
# You can pin to a specific version for reproducibility, e.g., ruby:3.3.9
FROM ruby:3.3

# Create and switch to the app directory inside the image.
WORKDIR /app

# Install system packages your app/gems might need.
RUN apt-get update -y &&     apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential nodejs git curl &&     rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set environment defaults for development.
ENV RACK_ENV=development     RAILS_ENV=development     BUNDLE_PATH=/usr/local/bundle

# Copy gem manifests first for layer caching.
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock* ./

# Install Ruby gems.
RUN bundle config set path "$BUNDLE_PATH" &&     bundle install --jobs=4 --retry=3

# Copy the rest of the app code.
COPY . .

# Expose the port (default 9292 for Rack/Sinatra apps).
EXPOSE 9292

# Optional healthcheck (adjust path if necessary).
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --retries=3   CMD curl -fsS "http://localhost:${PORT:-9292}/" || exit 1

# Default command for running the app.
CMD ["bash", "-lc", "bundle exec rackup -o 0.0.0.0 -p ${PORT:-9292}"]
````

---

### 2) `docker-compose.yml`

Copy this content into a new file named **docker-compose.yml**.

````yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile

    image: wordguesser:dev

    ports:
      - "9292:9292"

    volumes:
      - .:/app

    environment:
      - PORT=9292
      - RACK_ENV=development
      - RAILS_ENV=development
````

---

## B. Build the Image

Run this once to build your container image:

```
docker compose build
```

This uses your Dockerfile to produce an image named **wordguesser:dev** and caches the gem installation layer for faster rebuilds.

---

## C. Run the App Locally

Start the containerized app:

```
docker compose up
```

Then open a browser to:

```
http://localhost:9292
```

To stop the container, press **Ctrl+C**.  
To run in detached mode, use `docker compose up -d` and later `docker compose down`.

---

## D. Run Tests Inside the Container

You’ll now use Docker to execute your RSpec and Cucumber tests, ensuring a consistent environment for everyone.

**Run RSpec:**
```
docker compose run --rm app bash -lc "bundle exec rspec"
```

**Run Cucumber:**
```
docker compose run --rm app bash -lc "bundle exec cucumber"
```

To open an interactive shell in the container:
```
docker compose run --rm app bash
```

---

## E. Clean Rebuild (if needed)

When gems or dependencies change, do a clean rebuild:

```
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up --force-recreate
```

---

## F. Quick Explanation of What Changed

- **Dockerfile** → defines the container image (what software and tools are installed)  
- **docker-compose.yml** → defines how to run the container (ports, volumes, env vars)  
- Together, they let you run and test the app in a consistent, reproducible environment.

---

## G. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Port already in use:**  
  Change the **host** port in the `ports:` mapping, e.g. `"9393:9292"`.

- **Gem install errors:**  
  You may need extra libraries. Add them to the `apt-get install` line, then rebuild.

- **File or path issues:**  
  Ensure the container’s working directory matches the app’s structure (`/app`).

---

## H. What to Submit

1. A working `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root  
2. Screenshots showing:
   - The app running in the browser  
   - Passing RSpec and Cucumber output  
3. A short writeup (2–3 sentences) on what you learned from containerizing the app

---

## I. Reflection Questions

Answer briefly in your README or in a separate file:

1. **Reproducibility:**  
   How does containerization help ensure that your app runs consistently across different machines and environments?

2. **Separation of Concerns:**  
   Why do Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml serve different purposes? How might Compose help if this app later needs a database or other services?
