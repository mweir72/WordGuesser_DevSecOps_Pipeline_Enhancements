Wordguesser (Is the pipeline working?!)
=============================================================

(v1.1, September 2015.  Written by Armando Fox and Nick Herson)

(other updates from Michael Ball and others)

This codebase originated as an assignment for a software engineering course wherein students would incrementally develop a ruby version of Wordguesser (Hangman) using BDD and TDD, then wrap it in a Sinatra web server.

In this DevOps course, we will use the completed solution to this assignment as a starting point in an exercise to containerize the app and add it to a CI/CD pipeline.

## 0) Fork & Clone

In your browser, fork the repo from:  
[https://github.com/citadelcs/wordguesser](https://github.com/citadelcs/wordguesser)

Then clone your fork locally:

    git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/wordguesser.git
    cd wordguesser

If the repo is private, make sure you have access and your SSH key is added to GitHub.

## 1) Install Prerequisites

### Ubuntu (22.04/24.04)

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y git build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libreadline-dev \
        libyaml-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev libdb-dev uuid-dev \
        ca-certificates curl


### macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)

1. Install Homebrew if you don’t have it:

       /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. Then install basic tools:

       brew install git openssl@3

## 2) Install `rbenv` and Ruby 3.3.9

### Ubuntu

    # install rbenv
    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    exec $SHELL -l
    

    # install ruby-build plugin
    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build

    # install Ruby 3.3.9
    rbenv install 3.3.9
    rbenv local 3.3.9
    ruby -v

### macOS

    brew install rbenv ruby-build
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    exec $SHELL -l

    rbenv install 3.3.9
    rbenv local 3.3.9
    ruby -v

If you get OpenSSL errors on macOS:

    brew install openssl@3
    RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)" rbenv install 3.3.9

## 3) Install Bundler & Gems

From the project root:

    gem install bundler
    bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
    bundle install

If you get errors during installation, check that you’re using Ruby 3.3.9:

    ruby -v

## 4) Run Tests

Run the RSpec test suite:

    bundle exec rspec

Run the Cucumber tests:

    bundle exec cucumber

✅ You should see passing (or at least runnable) tests.  
If not, check the error messages carefully — they usually point to missing dependencies or setup steps.

## 5) Run the App

Start the app:

    bundle exec rackup

By default it runs on [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)

To use a different port:

    bundle exec rackup -p 3000

Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

## 6) Common Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| `rbenv: version '3.3.9' not installed` | Run `rbenv install 3.3.9` and reopen your shell (`exec $SHELL -l`). |
| `bundle: command not found` | Run `gem install bundler`. |
| `openssl` build errors on macOS | Run `brew install openssl@3` and reinstall Ruby with:<br>`RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)" rbenv install 3.3.9` |
| `rspec` or `cucumber` not found | Always prefix commands with `bundle exec`, e.g. `bundle exec rspec`. |
| Permissions or file-mode issues | Run `git config core.fileMode false` if needed. |

If you continue to have issues, confirm your environment:

    ruby -v
    which ruby
    which bundle

Both `ruby` and `bundle` should come from your rbenv installation (usually under `~/.rbenv/shims`).

## 7) What to Submit for Part 1

Submit the following evidence to your instructor:

- A screenshot or short note showing:
    - Ruby `3.3.9` active (`ruby -v`)
    - Successful `bundle install`
    - Output from `bundle exec rspec` and `bundle exec cucumber`
    - The app running locally in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔜 Next Steps (Preview)

In **[Part 2](part2.md)**, you will:

- Containerize this Ruby app using **Docker**
- Write a **GitHub Actions** workflow to build and test the app automatically
- (Optional) Push the image to a container registry

Before moving on, make sure all tests pass and the app runs cleanly on your local system.
